# Overview
This package help you create native looking addins for solidworks. Solidworks is extremely powerful and its API is well documented by Dassault Systems. However Solidworks uses COM and communicates with its addins using primitive types (most of the times). This package is unique in the sense that it follows best practices of OOP and wraps API functions in a proper object. To put it other words, it acts as a proxy between your code and solidworks API.
Solidworks is knows to be easy to use. And there are two main reasons for it. Firstly, It is a feature-rich software that has a solution for most users requirements. Secondly, it has a powerful UI to deliver that richness in an intuitive way. This package is focused on the UI side of things. Of course, you could follow solidworks API documents and make addins that look and feel like solidworks UI. But because solidworks is based on COM you would end up struggling with primitive types like `string` to define a simple logo for your addin. And by the time you figure that one up, you'd have to sort out the `id` numbers for all your `Controllers`.
