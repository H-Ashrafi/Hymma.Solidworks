# Class Diagrams
These are generated by [jebbs.plantuml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for VS code. You can open each one of the `.puml` files and see the structure for yourself or open the [Hymma.SOlidworks.Addins.PlantUmlDiagrams.svg](./Hymma.Solidworks.Addins.PlantUMLDiagrams.svg) And see the complete picture :)
There are multiple ways to regenerate these files automatically using a combinations of github actions and [npm packages](https://github.com/danielyaa5/puml-for-markdown). 
But there will be no attempt to make this happen any soon. As such it is not guaranteed that these diagrams are up-to-date. Regardless they provide a very good understating of the object model in this package.
